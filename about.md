I'm an undergrad at Yale University ('22) studying Computing and the Arts, a joint computer science and art major. This summer, I will be joining Amazon as a UX/UI Design Intern.

I’ve always loved exploring how to create meaningful experiences, whether it be through interactive storytelling or product development. This combined with my background in computer science and art has led me to become passionate about product, user experience, and design.

When I'm not designing, coding, or serving as VP of [UXSociety at Yale](https://uxsocietyyale.org/) you can find me dancing to kpop with Yale Movement, doodling cartoons, and penny boarding down the street.

Let’s get in touch if you have a project or collaboration in mind. :)
