# Mobile App Prototyping

**Duration**    December 2019 (1 week)

**Tools**    Figma

**Key Skills**    UI/UX, Mobile App Prototyping, User Research

**Background**      
In the fall semester of my sophomore year at Yale, I had the pleasure of taking “The Mystery of Sleep”, a cognitive science course that covered the science behind sleep. The knowledge I gained about the importance of sleep made a huge impact on me—studying the research on the detrimental effects of sleep deprivation as well as the benefits of a consistent sleep pattern helped push me to seek ways to improve my own sleep.

## Problem

Many products exist to improve sleep quality, but not many are designed with the intent of improving chronic sleep deprivation or creating real behavioral change. 

## Solution

**I want to design an easy way for people to not only achieve better sleep but to also develop better sleep habits that will improve their overall sleep quality in the long run.**

## Observations and Research

Sleep is often not prioritized, especially in a college environment, but taking this course has proven to me that this is definitely not the right attitude that people should hold. Through **user interviews** and **secondary research**, I saw the need for an easy way for people to consistently achieve better sleep.

### User Interviews

I interviewed 5 people–4 were my classmates, and 1 was my older sister who had been facing severe sleep problems in her working life. I wanted to target people who were students, as this group tends to have busy schedules and poorer sleeping habits, or people who generally had issues with their sleep. I noticed a few common findings among them:

**All were somewhat unsatisfied with their sleep.**

**All knew of good sleep habits but did not always actualize them.**

All users had knowledge of good sleep habits as well as the detriments of sleep deprivation, yet they did not always actualize them and were still unsatisfied with their current sleep. This begs the question of how to create a product that can push people to actually put these habits into practice.

Their thoughts on their ideal sleep app revealed **the need for a simple, unobtrusive way to be more motivated to achieve better sleep as well as the need for tools to help people fall asleep more easily.**

### Secondary Research

A 2017 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5350571/) led by Diana S. Grigsby-Toussaint, a kinesiology and community health professor from the University of Illinois, on the 35 most popular sleep apps confirms the sentiment that there is still room for improvement for sleep apps. Although the study found that the majority of apps were well-designed and allowed its users to set goals and track their sleep, **very few apps had features that supported long-term behavioral changes**. Out of all 35 apps, only:

* 4 apps provided information about the benefits of sleep
* 4 apps provided information about the risks of sleep deprivation
* 6 apps offered reminder messages for sleep
* 1 app gave positive reinforcement for reaching a sleep goal

Integrating these features into a sleep app will help people develop better, more sustainable sleep hygiene that will improve their overall quality of life.

## Features and Prototyping

A rounded sans-serif font such as Nunito is gentle to look at. The dark blue, which serves as the primary background color in the app, mimics a night sky and is easy on the eyes in the evening.

### Design Decision 1

**Simulated sunrise alarm and soothing music as you go to sleep**

**Circadian rhythm** is a key process that determines your sleep and wakefulness. **Light** is mainly responsible for affecting the central clock in your body, so waking up to a simulated sunrise is less harsh and more natural than a sudden strong alarm.

I also incorporated the option to play soothing music once the user starts the sleep tracker/alarm, as this helps people fall asleep more easily, and the user interviews expressed a desire for this feature.

Furthermore, the feature to stop the alarm through methods such as shaking your phone, flipping the phone orientation, or simply tapping a button is offered. **Giving alternative and active ways to stop an alarm can encourage users to wake up more alert.**

### Design Decision 2

**Daily reports on sleep and trends on your sleep time, sleep quality, sleep debt, and sleep regularity**

Keeping a sleep log is a good way to see where the user can make improvements in their life to improve sleep. Highlights of average sleep time, sleep quality and sleep regularity per week or month are placed at the very top of the trend report page for a quick and easy summary of this key information.

### Design Decision 3

**Reminder messages to wind down, reduce screen time, and prepare for sleep as well as information on your sleep progress and sleep debt**

Push notifications will be offered to help users be reminded of not only their bedtime but also when they should start preparing for sleep. This will help people fall asleep easier and faster.

In addition, receiving notifications on how much regular sleep or sleep debt the user has gotten over a certain period of time will help motivate people to either continue their current behavior or improve it.

Praise for consistent good sleep habits is encouraging. An instance of the incorporation of praise is upon opening the app—the starting page will have a banner at the top of the screen praising the user for achieving regular sleep for however many days.

### Design Decision 4

**Provide information about the benefits of sleep, the risks of sleep deprivation, and how to achieve better sleep**

From my personal experience of taking my course on sleep as well as feedback from user interviews, more awareness of the benefits of sleep and the consequences of no sleep encourages users to create better sleep habits and sleep hygiene for themselves. Having this information available and sprinkled throughout the app will serve as a constant reminder of why users need high-quality sleep.
