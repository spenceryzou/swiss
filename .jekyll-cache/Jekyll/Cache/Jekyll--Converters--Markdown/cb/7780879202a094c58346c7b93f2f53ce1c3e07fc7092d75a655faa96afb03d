<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>

<p><strong>Background</strong> Â Â Â HiveDesk is a B2B SaaS product that tracks remote worker productivity by taking random automated screenshots of workersâ€™ screens. It has a customer base in the hundreds and is managed by a small team in GlowTouch Technologies, a technology company based in Louisville, Kentucky. As a summer 2019 intern at GlowTouch, I had the opportunity to assist with the product marketing and management of HiveDesk.</p>

<p><strong>The Problem</strong> Â Â Â HiveDesk has been stagnating in customer growth for over a year. One way to tackle this issue is through small and easy-to-implement UI/UX techniques that influence users to move beyond the homepage and to the free trial download page. I redesigned the homepage with this intention of increasing user conversions and free trial downloads.</p>

<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>

<p>The main team consisted of six people, and each primarily focused on product marketing. The software development team for HiveDesk was based in GlowTouchâ€™s India office. I shared my decision decisions with the co-founder of HiveDesk and one of the product marketers. In the end, these two made the final calls for my designs.</p>

<p>This is the old, original HiveDesk homepage:</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/hivedesk old.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I analyzed this version of the homepage and used various psychological and marketing techniques outlined by psychologist <a href="https://www.nickkolenda.com/my-guides/">Nick Kolenda</a>. A couple of factors immediately stuck out to me that could be changed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Less is moreâ€”the overall amount of information on the page should be reduced to increase the userâ€™s focus on the primary goal</strong>. Most notably, the numerous links in the navigation bar, as well as the heavy-text descriptions of the product and the company, are extraneous. Users have limited focus, so they should have their attention pointed towards the most important information and the main call to actionâ€”starting a free trial. By having a more focused page with fewer links and text, conversions are more likely to increase.</li>
  <li><strong>Attention needs to be more easily directed to the call-to-action, especially at the top of the funnel</strong>. Adjustments relying on tactics such as the mere exposure effect by repeating the CTA button will influence users more easily. Adding more attention especially at the beginning of the conversion funnel, when users first land on the page, will help increase conversions in further stages of the funnel.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="features-and-prototyping">Features and Prototyping</h2>

<p>I implemented numerous UI changes across the page. These changes intentionally appeal to the productâ€™s target users, emphasize the CTA button, encourage users to continue scrolling down the page, and overall direct the user to the main goal.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/hd_final.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Since the team mainly wanted to incorporate small, low-effort UI changes to the homepage, my redesign was not fully implemented by the end of my time at GlowTouch. However, my design decisions such as the reduction of links in the top navigation bar, the repeating of the CTA button at the top of the page, and the removal of the extraneous blocks of descriptive text were made.</p>

<p><strong>As a result, the CTR from homepage to free-trial-page as well as the number of users scrolling down the entire homepage increased from 1.7% to 2.1%â€“approximately, a 24% increase</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="results-and-learnings">Results and Learnings</h2>

<p>Redesigning the homepage showed me how just a few simple changes could be the deciding factor in whether a user chooses to try out a product or not. If the user cannot be properly convinced to use the product, it will struggle to gain more users.</p>

<p>In the future, one thing I would like to A/B test is the opening headline and header image that the user first sees upon homepage arrival. The original homepage had a headline that described what the product itself was and had a header image of the productâ€™s dashboard pages in the background. I intentionally chose a headline that focused on the target userâ€™s expected desires and chose a header image that would direct attention to the CTA button. Gathering data on whether these changes actually increased conversion rates would provide stronger support for their implementation.</p>
