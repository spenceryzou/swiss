<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>As an assignment in my Intro to Graphic Design class, I was tasked to create a logo or visual mark of a physical place of personal meaning. The first place that came to mind was the childhood bedroom shared between my older sister and I. This room is like a time capsule for the two of usâ€”it is an assortment of objects and memories from different people and different times that somehow form something that is still cohesive.</p>

<p>I call it <strong>the kidsâ€™ room</strong>.</p>

<p>A generic image search of logos for kids-related places and products revealed the common elements such as happy icons, blocky or bubble letter typography, and bright colors. While I wanted to have my logo to also have a childlike quality, I wanted to avoid relying on typical fonts and icons to achieve this.</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p>There were three design attributes that I wanted to express: <strong>youth</strong>, <strong>multifaceted</strong>, and <strong>foundational</strong>.</p>

<p>I began with the three basic shapes, circle, triangle, and square, to represent an elementary foundation. I drew the shapes with a rough brush by hand to create a more natural, childish effect.</p>

<p>I used slightly transparent gradients to evoke dynamic fluidity and transition. Playing around with patterns such as polka dots and lines added to the overall youth and playfulness of the identity.</p>

<p>The layering of the solid gradients vs. patterns created a multifaceted quality, giving the appearance of each shape having different layers of either the gradient or the pattern. This effect is important in conveying the layered nature of this room and its different appearances from certain perspectives.</p>

<h2 id="results-and-learnings">Results and Learnings</h2>

<p>Designing a logo is all about reductionâ€”how can we convey a meaning using as little elements as possible? Each element must carry meaning and intention with it in order to visually express the place it is representing. This mindset of intentional simplicity and clear expression is a skill that I have learned to apply to anything I design.</p>
